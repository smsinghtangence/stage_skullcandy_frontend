                    Here are the steps you will want to take to set up your new
                    Dime® 2 earbuds:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Take the earbuds out of the case and remove stickers from
                      charging contact points. We recommend you put the earbuds
                      back into the case to charge for about 30 minutes before
                      first use. Be sure the LEDs on the earbuds turn red – this
                      indicates charging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Once charged, remove the earbuds from the case to initiate
                      pairing. Both earbuds will automatically power on and the
                      LEDs will simultaneously flash blue while they sync to each
                      other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Once the earbuds have synced together, you’ll hear a voice
                      prompt that says ‘Pairing’. Only the left earbud will begin
                      to flash red/blue. From your device, turn on Bluetooth and
                      look for ‘Dime® 2’ in your list of available Bluetooth
                      Devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Select “Dime” and accept any “Pair” or “OK” prompts that
                      appear on your screen. When pairing is complete a voice
                      prompt will say ‘Connected’. Now that Dime® 2 is paired,
                      you’re good to go.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <h1>PAIRING A NEW DEVICE</h1>
                  <p>
                    If you have already set-up and paired to one device, you can
                    easily pair to another device by following these simple steps.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Manually Power Off your earbuds with a 4-second button hold.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      While Off, press and hold both earbuds again for 4 seconds.
                      this will manually “Power On”, sync, and then enter your
                      earbuds directly into “Pairing” Mode. At this time, your
                      LEFT earbud will begin to flash red/blue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Simply then search and select Dime® 2 in your available
                      Bluetooth Device list to pair your new device.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Issue: </strong>The biggest challenge with true
                    wireless earbuds is ensuring your buds are properly connected
                    to each other and your device. There are times when you may
                    unintentionally disconnect your buds and change their paired
                    state; this can create pairing challenges and impact your
                    ability to hear audio in both earbuds or use either bud in
                    Solo Mode. Do not worry, we have a few easy ways to get this
                    fixed!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>First complete a power cycle</strong> by simply
                    placing your buds into the charging case until the LED on both
                    earbuds turns RED. Then remove your buds from the case and
                    evaluate, sometimes this is all you need, but if you’re still
                    having trouble we’ve got you covered.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

                    <li>
                      Power ON your earbuds by removing them from the charging
                      case, or manually press and hold the button on each bud for
                      2 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Once powered ON (you can be in a connected or non-connected
                      state) press the button on BOTH buds 4x to start the earbuds
                      re-sync pairing mode (earbuds connecting to each other).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Your earbuds will flash Red/Blue momentarily as they
                      re-sync, once successful they will flash Blue together and
                      you will hear a “connected” voice prompt.

                    <li>
                      If you were connected to your device, your earbuds will
                      automatically reconnect to your device and you’re ready to
                      stream in stereo audio (sound will play from both earbuds).

                      To ensure ease of re-pairing, please un-pair or forget your
                      Dime® 2 in your paired Bluetooth device list
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Remove your Dime® 2 earbuds from the charging case and allow
                      them to automatically power ON.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ensure your earbuds are in a non-connected state, then on
                      either earbud, press the button 2x and then hold for 2
                      seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This will automatically reset your paired device list and

                    <li>
                      At this time, turn ON your device’s Bluetooth and look for
                      “Dime” in your list of Available Bluetooth devices, and
                      select it.

                    <li>
                      IMPORTANT – Select the “Pair” and “Ok” prompts that will pop

                  <h2>SOLO MODE</h2>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Issue: </strong>If you would like to use Dime® 2 with
                    only one ear bud (Solo Mode), you’re in luck! The updated
                    technology in Dime® 2 allows you to use either the left OR the
                    right bud in Solo Mode. Once paired correctly, you will be
                    able to switch seamlessly between your right and left earbud.
                    Although, if you’re having any challenges utilizing the Role
                    Switching capabilities, you may follow these simple steps to
                    ensure ease of use when pairing and switching between Solo and
                    Stereo Modes.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Please note – BOTH the LEFT and RIGHT bud for Dime® 2 can be
                      used in Solo Mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For the optimal Solo Mode functionality, first Power ON and
                      pair your buds to your device normally or as described in
                      our troubleshooting section. This will ensure the seamless
                      transition between Stereo and Solo modes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Once you’ve paired your earbuds you can simply remove either
                      your left or right earbud from the case and it will connect
                      to your device in Solo Mode. At any time, you can remove the
                      other bud from the case, it will automatically sync and
                      begin streaming audio in Stereo Mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Additionally, if you’re already streaming in Stereo Mode,
                      simply place the RIGHT or LEFT bud back into the case;
                      whichever you prefer! The remaining bud will stay paired and
                      function with both phone calls and music.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In Solo Mode you will maintain your Play/Pause, Answer/Hang
                      up Call and Activate Assistant functionality, but please
                      note you will lose some of the media control functionality
                      such as “Volume +/- “, and “Track &lt;&lt;/&gt;&gt;”.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Again, if you would like to change back to Stereo Mode while
                      in Solo Mode, simply pull the other bud from the case at any
                      time and you will hear a tone, or the music will seamlessly
                      begin to stream to indicate that you have automatically
                      entered back into Stereo Mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Please Note</strong> – If you’re having any trouble
                      switching between the LEFT and RIGHT buds in Solo Mode, you
                      may need to follow the reset solutions above to regain
                      proper functionality.

                      First ensure your case is charged up. If your charge case
                      battery is dead your earbuds will not automatically power
                      off and begin to charge when placed into the case.

                    <li>
                      Check to see if any debris is blocking the charging pins in
                      the case, or on the bud

                    <li>
                      Check to see if the removable in-ear gels are placed

                      buds from sitting correctly in the case

                      This same issue could also be interfering with your case lid
                      when closing, if you’re having a hard time closing the lid

                      With this new design, there is no wrong way to plug the
                      USB-A side of your cable into your power source. The
                      non-directional plug just makes it quicker and easier to
                      plug in since you don’t need to figure out if it’s upside
                      down or not.{" "}

                      Since the charge case is so insanely small, the provided
                      lanyard accessory is used to connect/clip your case and
                      earbuds to your key chain, backpack, really anything you
                      want. You’ll have no problem carrying your earbuds with you

                      This improved earbud to earbud pairing solution will not

                      they have issues with the buds pairing together. Simply
                      re-sync your earbuds following solution 1 above and quickly
                      get audio streaming from both buds in no time.

                      This allows both the LEFT and RIGHT bud to act as the
                      Primary bud, which allows more media controls and features
                      to be activated from either side. Functions such as,
                      play/pause, answer call/hang up call, Activate Assistant can
                      be controlled on both the LEFT and RIGHT bud, simplifying
                      the user experience.

                      This feature also allows you to utilize either the LEFT or

                      Dime® 2 has a water resistant rating of (IPX4). This will
                      allow them to hold up to some rain and moisture with no
                      problems at all.

                    <li>
                      Please note that ONLY the buds have the IPX4 rating. The
                      charging case does NOT have an IPX4 rating so you want to be
                      a bit more careful with that.
